HTML/CSS Setup: Create an HTML canvas for the game visuals styled with CSS. Design a bird and poles.
Physics and Gameplay: Implement JavaScript to apply physics, like gravity, to the bird's flight. Track pole collisions and increment points when crossing, ending the game on collision.
User Interaction: Allow player control (e.g., click) to keep the bird flying. Display the score and a restart option when the game ends.
Add user interactivity through mouse clicks or keyboard input to control the bird's flight and restart the game after a collision for an engaging bird-game experience.
